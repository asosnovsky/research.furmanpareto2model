# Research Work Furman-Modified-Pareto2 Distribution Model

## `/theory` folder
contains several testing of the maximum likelihood estimation (mle) as well as moment-based estimation (MM) for the Furman-Pareto2 Distribution against classical cases of independent pareto and the dependend pareto distributions.

## `/app` folder
contains 1 file: `Texas-test.m`, which will test the distribution against data gathered from the state of texas.
For this make sure to run the `R-scripts` in `/data/` before starting work!

## `/data` folder
Contains scripts for automated downaloaded and cleaning of US-income data and catastrophe data

## `/gui` folder
contains the matlab scripts to generate a java gui using the MM estimation with the furman-pareto2 distribution
